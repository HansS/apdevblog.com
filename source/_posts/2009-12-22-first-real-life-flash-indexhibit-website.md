Hi there &#8230; it&#8217;s been a bit quiet here over the last month, but only because we had loads of work to do before christmas.  
I just wanted to let you know, that we built our first real life Flash/Indexhibit website a few weeks ago &#8211; for a good friend who&#8217;s a photographer.

<a href="http://www.lisahoerterer.de" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-745" title="lisa hörterer" src="/images/2009/12/lisa-screenshot.jpg" alt="lisa hörterer" width="510" height="340" /></a>

<!--more-->

We took the [example][1] we posted earlier and made some minor changes here and there while focusing on the presentation of the photographs.  
There is a slideshow-feature, thumbnails, paging and fullscreen view of the photographs. And we put together a little script adjusting the size of the images to the browser-window without losing quality.

Take a look and maybe it&#8217;s kind of a motivation for you to go and try our Flash/Indexhibit code-base for yourself!?

whole thing is based on: <a href="http://indexhibit.org/" target="_blank">indexhibit</a>

cheers + and of course a merry christmas
