Keith Peters started hosting the great <a title="the 25-line actionscript contest" href="http://www.25lines.com/" target="_blank">25 lines contest</a> (again) &#8211; a contest where you can do anything you want only it has to fit into 25 lines of ActionScript 3 code.

I&#8217;m really curious what people will contribute. There are some nice <a title="25 lines prizes" href="http://www.25lines.com/?p=56" target="_blank">prizes</a> up for grabs &#8230; go, check&#8217;em out.

And now we only have to come up with an idea of our own &#8230; mmmm.

Cheers, phil
