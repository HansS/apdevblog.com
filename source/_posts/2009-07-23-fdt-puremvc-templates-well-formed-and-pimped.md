I finally managed to install the FDT pureMVC code templates found [here][1]. Thanks for that pedr.

However, I made some changes to make them fit 100% on our needs. I changed the syntax style (blanks before and after type and wrap braces) and added some more informations to the class comment. Also I changed the signature of the Proxy and Mediator constructor (no name is passed). Finally to shortcuts to the template now simply start with &#8220;p&#8221;.
