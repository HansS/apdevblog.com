We are back from Brighton &#8230;. and it really was a blast!  
Despite the time of year the weather was great &#8211; especially after last year&#8217;s monsoon-like rains on the coast of Britain. We arrived in Brighton on Monday morning and went straight to the beautiful venue &#8211; the Brighton Dome. On the first day we attended some really interesting sessions:

*   <a title="gSkinner" href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grant Skinner</a>&#8216;s / 50 reasons AS3 kicks ass
*   Scotsman <a href="http://hossgifford.com" target="_blank">Hoss Gifford</a> amused us with his talk about &#8220;The tip of the iceberg&#8221;
*   The great <a title="Joshua Davis" href="http://www.joshuadavis.com" target="_blank">Joshua Davis</a> started his session rappin&#8217; &#8230; WORD!

The first party was supposed to be in the seaside casino in Brighton &#8211; but after waiting for about 2 hours to get in (w/o drinks &#8230;) we decided it was time to check the local bars :)  
The second day was as good as the first. Mentionable sessions were:

*   <a title="Craig Swann" href="http://www.crashmedia.com/" target="_blank">Craig Swann</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Perceptive Interactions + Alternative Interfaces&#8221;
*   <a title="Mario Klingemann" href="http://www.quasimondo.com" target="_blank">Mario</a> had fun dancing with his gloves during his &#8220;2D or not 2D that is the question&#8221; session
*   <a title="flight404" href="http://www.flight404.com" target="_blank">Robert Hodgin</a> didn&#8217;t really talk about Flash but his (mainly) Processing topics were off-the-wall

Because we already saw <a title="Andre Michelle" href="http://blog.andre-michelle.com/" target="_blank">Andre Michelle</a>&#8216;s &#8220;Klangfabrik&#8221; in Cologne the other day, we decided to stick with <a title="Neville Brody" href="http://www.researchstudios.com/" target="_blank">Neville Brody</a> &#8211; a good choice, because he really showed some amazing works. The last session just blew our minds: <a title="Jared Tarbell" href="http://www.complexification.net/" target="_blank">Jared Tarbell</a> had ace after ace up his sleeve.  
Ooooh &#8230; i almost forgot to mention the &#8220;inspired sessions&#8221; from <a title="Erik Natzke" href="http://www.natzke.com/" target="_blank">Erik Natzke</a> and <a title="Brendan Dawes" href="http://www.brendandawes.com/" target="_blank">Brendan Dawes</a> &#8211; they really were &#8230; inspiring :D We just laid back, had some beer and listened to them telling about their most recent masterpieces &#8211; thumbs up!

So, all in all we hope to get back to Brighton next year &#8211; and maybe next time we&#8217;ll even be able to play some roulette or poker ;)
