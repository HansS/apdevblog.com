This is just a small update to the sources of our <a href="/flash-frontend-for-indexhibit-cms/" target="_blank">Flash / Indexhibit example</a> we posted earlier.  
I added a FLA file for all of you that never used the Flex-compiler before :)

Just <a href="/sources-for-flash-frontend-for-indexhibit-cms/" target="_blank">download the sources</a> and open the ndxz.fla in (at least) Flash CS3. Hit cmd-return and enjoy.

When I have the time, I still want to build another very simple example that only uses assets from the library so that you can just change colors and forms on the timeline and re-compile the whole project with some great new looks.

Have fun. Cheers
