- [Cookieless Domain vs. DNS lookups](http://www.jonathanklein.net/2014/02/revisiting-cookieless-domain.html)  
Finally some stats regarding that issue.
- [Gulp vs. Grunt](http://javascriptjabber.com/097-jsj-gulp-js-with-eric-schoffstall/)  
The guys from the JavaScript Jabber podcast talk to [Eric Schoffstall](https://twitter.com/eschoff), one of the creators behind [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). Really interesting background info why they created a new build-system (instead of just using grunt).
- [Stephen Wolfram's Introduction to the Wolfram Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P9HqHVPeik)
