This issue of our weekly digest has a bit of everything: performance, tools,
security - audio, video, text ... Happy reading, watching, listening.<!-- more -->

- [Cookieless Domain vs. DNS lookups](http://www.jonathanklein.net/2014/02/revisiting-cookieless-domain.html)  
Finally some stats regarding that issue.
- [Gulp vs. Grunt](http://javascriptjabber.com/097-jsj-gulp-js-with-eric-schoffstall/)  
The guys from the JavaScript Jabber podcast talk to [Eric Schoffstall](https://twitter.com/eschoff), one of the creators behind [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). Really interesting background info why they created a new build-system (instead of just using grunt).
- [Stephen Wolfram's Introduction to the Wolfram Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P9HqHVPeik)  
Well, we should have a look at it, right?
- [ATOM](http://atom.io/)  
New "hackable" text editor from the people we love @ Github. Can't wait to get our hands on this one.
- [Salted Password Hashing - Doing it Right](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm)  
Some more input on securely saving passwords - as an addition to the article from last week: [salt'n'pepper - or how to store passwords securely](http://apdevblog.com/salt-n-pepper-or-how-to-store-passwords-securely/)
