Hi there.  
Just wanted to post that our new (second revision) Flash CS4 book is out and you can get it here:

<a href="http://www.galileodesign.de/katalog/buecher/titel/gp/titelID-1892" target="_blank">www.galileodesign.de</a>  
<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Flash-CS4-Workshops-Einsteiger-Fortgeschrittene/dp/3836212579/" target="_blank">www.amazon.de</a>

<img alt="" src="http://cover.galileo-press.de/9783836212571.jpg" title="Flash CS4" class="alignnone" width="500" />

<!--more-->

Aron and I wrote some nice tutorials about &#8230;

*   Tweening-engines
*   BitmapData
*   Flash Remoting
*   SWFObject / SWFAddress
*   AIR
*   &#8230;

So if you can speak german, this book is a must-have for any programmer who is new to actionscript3 and flash-development.

cheers
