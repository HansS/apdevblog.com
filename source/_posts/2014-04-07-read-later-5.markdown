Our "weekly digest" is now "read later" - because it wasn't really weekly and
most of the links were older anyway.  
So, without further ado, here are the links:

- [Edge conference videos are online](http://edgeconf.com/2014-london)  
"Relive every second of Edge with complete video coverage". Will do.
- [Code Guide by @mdo](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/)  
We are also planning to create Code Conventions apdev edition
- [What is a Heisenbug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)  
Conquer the Heisenbug, one of the most satisfying things in programming.
- [How much damage does third party content really do to e-commerce sites?](http://blog.intechnica.co.uk/2014/03/07/how-much-damage-does-third-party-content-really-do-to-ecommerce-sites-report/)  
Some additional info to our [own post about 3rd party content](http://apdevblog.com/mobile-performance-and-how-it-suffers-from-3rd-party-content/)
- [10 career-changing programming books](http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2014/02/05/top-10-career-changing-programming-books/)  
If you still need to read some more about programming ... maybe there's a book
on this list, that you haven't read already.
