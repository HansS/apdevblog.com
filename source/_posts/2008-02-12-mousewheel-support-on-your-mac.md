After struggling for some weeks now, I finally found a good implementation of the MouseEvent.MOUSE_WHEEL event for my Mac. Pixelbreaker &#8211; who already had a great AS2 MouseWheel script &#8211; just posted the new AS3 version. Read more about it on the <a href="http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/flash/as30-mousewheel-on-mac-os-x/" title="pixelbreaker mousewheel" target="_blank">pixelbreaker-blog</a>.

Have fun &#8230;
