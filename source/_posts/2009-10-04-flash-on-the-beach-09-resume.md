Second time (after <a href="/back-from-brighton/" target="_blank">2007</a>) for us being at <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/" target="_blank">FOTB</a> in Brighton this year &#8230; and I just wanted to write a small roundup to let all of you who couldn&#8217;t be there in person know what you missed out on ;)

All in all it was great &#8211; again! Not so much about Flash and ActionScript but nonetheless there were definitely some speakers that totally blew my mind.

<a href="http://www.joelgethinlewis.com/" target="_blank">Joel Gethin Lewis</a> &#8211; Epiphany  
The work he showed was really inspiring and he shared so much interesting background information about the projects he did during the last three years &#8211; some with <a href="http://www.uva.co.uk/" target="_blank">UVA</a>, some with his new company <a href="http://yesyesno.com/" target="_blank">yesyesno</a>. just great.

Oi, oi &#8230; craziest nerd-talk of the whole conference. although i didn&#8217;t really get half of what he said the things he showed the crowd were just amazing. his own framework to optimize ActionScript Bytecode called &#8220;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/apparat/" target="_blank">apparat</a>&#8221; made most of the tips <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank">grant skinner</a> was talking about the session before obsolete :)  
you can watch his session online: <a href="http://blog.joa-ebert.com/2009/09/28/fotb-recordings/" target="_blank">Leaving The Sandbox</a>

<a href="http://blog.blprnt.com/" target="_blank">Jer Thorp</a> &#8211; Hacking The Newsroom  
Jer was showing some really beautiful data visualization pieces of his and explained how he&#8217;s using APIs like the one from the N.Y. Times to create these artworks. Definitely something I want to try for myself in the weeks to come &#8230;

<a href="http://postspectacular.com/" target="_blank">Karsten Schmidt</a> &#8211; &#8220;We make our own tools, and then they shape us.&#8221;  
Another fellow German &#8211; and as the one before, he really amazed me showing all these fantastic &#8220;tools&#8221; he created over the last few years. If you&#8217;re into processing, he&#8217;s your guy. Just check out his open-source libraries at google code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/toxiclibs/" target="_blank">toxiclibs</a>. thumbs up!

<a href="http://www.andre-michelle.com/" target="_blank">André Michelle</a> &#8211; Kling Klang  
Like the good old techno DJ he is, André opened his Wednesday morning session (9:00am) with five minutes of deafening hobnox powered techno beats. after the usual basics of digital audio processing he finished showing a great &#8220;little&#8221; tool he created &#8211; don&#8217;t know what it was called anymore but check it out &#8230;



Of course, <a href="http://www.joshuadavis.com/" target="_blank">Joshua Davis</a> was fun as always, but we saw him like 5 or 6 times over the past three years and it seems that he needs some new stuff to show &#8230; he said that it&#8217;ll be his last talk for a while, so when he&#8217;ll be back it&#8217;ll be as awesome as ever &#8230;

If you have a chance to listen to anyone of these guys, don&#8217;t hesitate.

Cheers.
