<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">Goal:</span>

Create a mailing list.

<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">How to:</span>

*   Install app
*   Create a project
*   Import some email addresses as csv file
*   Sort email addresses
*   Export csv file
*   Done

<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">Background:</span>

I never had a mailing list inside my email app. I&#8217;m using Thunderbird for several years now, but i was always too lazy to create a proper mailing list. I know that sounds funny, but every time i want to send some birthday invitations I pick every email address one-by-one from the global address book (thats where Thunderbird puts all the addresses in, i ever wrote an email to or received an email from). Ridiculous!

So if you ever have a lot of time to order all your email addresses, this tool might help you.

Although the Application works stable there are some features we haven&#8217;t integrated yet. Also, there might be a bug on some scenarios around the corner. However: No beta this time&#8230; ;)

We implemented the updater, so you&#8217;ll be automatically informed when a new version is available.

As soon as we implemented some other features and cleaned up the source code, we will release the source code.
