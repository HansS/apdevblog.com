Nowadays, when you talk to a web developer about building a (mobile) website,
performance is one of the topics that comes up quickly. This is absolutely great
and we have to say 'thank you' to a bunch of

with these things.

So we developer care about:

- gzipping
- minify/uglify + concat HTML, JS and CSS
- all blocking JS at the bottom of the page
- caching
- fewer requests
- and a lot more ...

Each of the points above will improve your site's performance - sometimes more
sometimes less, depending - of course - on your site and its structure.
