![Madinspain 08][1]

Monday I got back from the [MadinSpain conference][2] that took place in Madrid Spain. We had a wounderful time hearing some nice talks, drinking brilliant spanish beer and taking part in the strange madrid nightlife.

The conference was anounced as &#8220;International Design Event&#8221; and we were a bit suprised when we noticed that only one third of the talks were given in english. They gave away headsets which we plugged inside a box next to the seat. So we felt a bit like in a UN conference&#8230;

<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">Highlights</span>

*   [AKQA][3]
*   [Farfar][4]
*   [Spin][5]
*   [Brand New School][6]
*   [Joshua Davis][7]

<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bold">Summary</span>

We hope that the conference will become more international in the future. I&#8217;m totally cool with spanish speaking speakers. But a more international audience would be nice (there were mostly madrid design students), since the networking thing is obviously a big part of this conference thing.
