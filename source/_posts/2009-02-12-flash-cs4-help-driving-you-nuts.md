hi there, long time no see &#8230; but we are very busy working on some interesting projects and writing the second edition of our &#8220;workshops for flash&#8221; book.  
the latter is also the reason why we are using flash cs4 more than we usually would &#8230; and especially the cs4-built-in-actionscript-editor &#8230; \*phew\* what a mess that is. no real auto-completion, no auto-import and the flash-help keeps opening my browser with the online flashhelp :( really annoying.  
but there are some ways around this behavior.

offline browser solution:

air app:
