We&#8217;re proud to announce our first open source project: the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/apdev-videoplayer/" target="_blank">Apdev Videoplayer</a>.

<a href="/examples/apdev_videoplayer/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-436" title="Apdev videoplayer" src="/images/2009/09/screenshot.jpg" alt="Apdev videoplayer" width="349" height="290" /></a>

It&#8217;s an ActionScript 3.0 script-only videoplayer that we&#8217;re releasing under the MIT license. So you can do with it whatever you want &#8211; change it, skin it or just tear it apart and use some snippets of our code. It&#8217;s up to you.

Another videoplayer you may ask? Well, we know there are lots of them out there. But this is ours and we know, why we&#8217;re using it day in day out. It&#8217;s easy to understand and therefore easy to use (which leads to &#8220;easy to skin&#8221;) and creates no big overhead to the rest of your AS3 project. So if you need a flexible AS3 videoplayer (and you don&#8217;t have your own yet), have a look at this one. If you already have your own, we would appreciate you [sharing your ideas with us][1].

Some of our player&#8217;s features are:

*   play/pause/autoplay
*   seek/scrub
*   change volume
*   fullscreen view
*   preview image
*   resizable
*   supports FLV, MOV, MP4 (h.264), &#8230;

And compared to Adobe&#8217;s FLVPlayback component our videoplayer super-small in size (11.5K to around 70-80K).

To better understand the videoplayer itself or how it is built, just take a look at the <a href="/examples/apdev_videoplayer/docs/" target="_blank">documentaion</a>.

There is also a wrapper class for a player that can easily be embedded into html &#8211; <a href="/examples/apdev_videoplayer/html.html" target="_blank">embed example</a>.

If you have any questions or even suggestions, don&#8217;t hesitate and contact us.

By the way, we&#8217;re cleaning up some of our code we have been using for the last years and I&#8217;m sure the videoplayer will get some open-source-company very soon ;)

Stay tuned.
