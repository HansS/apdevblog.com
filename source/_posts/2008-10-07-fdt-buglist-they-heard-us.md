Great news from our favorite ActionScript Editor [FDT][1]. After we post the [Unofficial FDT Buglist][2] the Powerflasher (the Company behind FDT) came with an [update to version 3.1][3] (which fixed some of the mentioned bugs and added new features). Some day later they initialized (just like we suggested) a [public buglist][4]. We will transfer the open bugs to them and close our post.

Thanks FDT Team. We are looking forward to the future of the best ActionScript editor on earth.
