hi there.  
just returned from cologne where FFK09 took place for the 9th time.  
we met a lot of people and had a great time with the different talks &#8211; some i&#8217;d like to point out. so, if you&#8217;ll have the chance to check them out &#8211; don&#8217;t miss &#8216;em.

Audiotool Private Parts &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=U&#038;start=1&#038;q=http://blog.joa-ebert.com/" target="_blank">Joa Ebert</a>  
joa offered a big insight into his (and the <a href="http://www.hobnox.com/index.1046.html" target="_blank">hobnox/audiotool</a>) work &#8211; really fun hearing him talk about how much flash sucks but at the same time see him doing such beautiful things with it &#8230;

Selbst die Kunst kennt jetzt das Internet &#8211; <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=U&#038;start=5&#038;q=http://www.tomato.co.uk/" target="_blank">Joel Baumann</a>  
one of the few guys that talked more about design than flash itself. would love to see more sessions like this one &#8211; inspiring!

10 Hot Minutes &#8211; Cannasse, Ebert, Klingemann, Michelle, Reitberger  
every one of the above had 10 minutes showing off their flash skills. not everybody succeeded in leaving us with our jaws open &#8230; i really liked joa&#8217;s 300.000 particles, andré&#8217;s guitar and mario&#8217;s van gogh.

What is SWF? &#8211; <a href="http://www.ncannasse.fr/" target="_blank">Nicolas Cannasse</a>  
again, great insights into the world of flash compilers, haXe and code optimization in general.

Boing Bumm Tschak &#8211; <a href="http://blog.andre-michelle.com/" target="_blank">André Michelle</a>  
despite being seriously ill, andré&#8217;s talk was really entertaining &#8211; i&#8217;m not so much into all this audio-programming stuff, but had a great time listening to him talk about it :)

last session with <a href="http://www.quasimondo.com/" target="_blank">mario klingemann</a> &#8211; was really looking forward to this one, but i was a bit disappointed. maybe it was because of his jet-lag (mario just flew over from <a href="http://www.fitc.ca/" target="_blank">FITC</a> / toronto) &#8230; but he definitely lacked the enthusiasm that i so liked about him in prior sessions &#8230; too bad :(

all in all, we had some fun while also learning a great deal.

by the way &#8211; joa and andré revealed that hobnox will start to make parts of the audiotool open source: <a href="http://opensource.hobnox.com" target="_blank">opensource.hobnox.com</a>

if you&#8217;re interested, here are some really great pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcthiele/" target="_blank">marc</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johndavey/" target="_blank">john</a> &#8211; i just picked one to show in this post:
