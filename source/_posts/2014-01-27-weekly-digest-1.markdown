Today we are starting a new type of post: a weekly digest of articles, videos
or just links we stumbled upon during the last week. They don't have to be
brand-new, hyped or hot on Hacker News to get onto our list (link #1 is from 2012)
... instead being great, entertaining or just full of good stuff helps a lot :)<!-- more -->

Maybe we got something you haven't read/watched before:

- [Introduction to NoSQL by Martin Fowler](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI_g07C_Q5I)  
Great introductory video about NoSQL and its rivalry with other RDBMS.
- [Webinar: Getting Started with MongoDB - Back to Basics](http://www.mongodb.com/webinar/intro_mongodb_jan14)  
If you want to dive into developing applications backed by MongoDB.
- [Pete Hunt: React: Rethinking best practices -- JSConf EU 2013](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY)  
Very tempting their approach of always be able to render the current state of the application. Their virtual DOM sounds like voodoo. We need to do a real life test.
- [A game of inches](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/07.html)  
Ever worked two days on an optimization of a feature? An optimization that most users probably won't notice and is - in manager terms - very minor? You worked on it because it makes a difference. Because software development is a "game of inches".
- [Everpix - the story](http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup)  
"why the world's best photo startup is going out of business"
