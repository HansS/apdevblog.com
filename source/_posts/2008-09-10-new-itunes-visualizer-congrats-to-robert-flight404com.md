I always had the feeling, that the [Magnetosphere iTunes visualizer][1] from [the babarian group][2] was the most underrated piece of software ever.

Apple is Apple, they really have some good taste. Since last night Magnetosphere is the [default iTunes Visualizer][3].

Even the old shortcuts are still working (press ?).

Congrats to Robert and the barbarian group. And thx for the most beautiful processing visualization ever. Big work!
