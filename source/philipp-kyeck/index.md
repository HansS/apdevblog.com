After studying computer science Philipp Kyeck began working as a Flash developer and technical project manager for argonautenG2 in Berlin. In 2006 he started his freelance career developing Flash and Flex application for agencies as well as clients directly.

Leaving Flash/ActionScript behind, Philipp turned to Objective-C and iOS programming.
After a short stint in native apps, the openess of the web convinced him to once again switch his focus to "pure" web development - becoming a (mostly) JavaScript developer and consultant for front- and backend applications.

Besides working as an author for <a href="http://www.galileo-press.de" target="_blank">Galileo Press</a>, Philipp is sometimes teaching programming/multimedia engineering classes at <a href="http://www.beuth-hochschule.de/" target="_blank">Beuth Hochschule f√ºr Technik Berlin</a>.
