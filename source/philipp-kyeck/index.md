After studying computer science Philipp Kyeck began working as a developer and technical project manager for argonautenG2 in Berlin. In 2006 he started his freelance career developing Flash and Flex applications for agencies as well as clients directly.

Leaving Flash/ActionScript behind, Philipp turned to Objective-C and iOS programming.
After a short stint in native apps, the openess of the web convinced him to once again switch his focus to "pure" web development - becoming a (mostly) JavaScript developer and consultant for front- and backend applications.

Besides working as an author for [Galileo Press][2], Philipp is sometimes teaching programming/multimedia engineering classes at [Beuth Hochschule f√ºr Technik Berlin][3].
